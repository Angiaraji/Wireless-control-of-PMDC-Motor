Wireless control of prototype of PMDC Motor using PI and Fuzzy logic

A prototype of Pemanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor is controlled wirelessly
using bluetooth module hosted on the ARM7 microcontroller unit that 
implements the proposed logic drive. A handheld device acts as master that
communicates with the bluetooth module that acts as slave. The motor is 
driven individually with PI controller and Fuzzy logic controller by the 
selection of buttons on the microcontroller. The performance of the motor
with PI controller and Fuzzy controller are observed and compared. 

This project has been presented in the National Level Conference and the
paper is published in the International Journal of Applied Engineering Research (IJAER).
